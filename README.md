# Test task for Frontend 

Hello! If you want to become a part of our FE team of Open Source International company, you need to complete a small test.  

## What should be done? 

- fork this repository to your github account 

- implement a landing page as described below 

- publish it on github pages 

- send us your github account and a link to the published site here hr@o-s-i.org (Subject > Test task - Frontend Team > Name Surname) 

- wait for feedback 


It is necessary to implement the landing page, using the test work requirements as described below.  


## Test work requirements 

- Use GULP task runner (https://gulpjs.com/). 

- Use Nunjucks for markup (https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). 

- Use SASS for styles (https://sass-lang.com/). 

- HTML/CSS should be valid (https://validator.w3.org/). 

- Images should be compressed 

- Use BEM naming convensions (https://en.bem.info/methodology/ , https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/). 

- Using vanilla JS/ES6+ would be a big plus. 


 ### GULP TASKS: 

- templates (for Nunjucks compilation)  

- styles (for SASS compilation) 

- server (for start local server) 

- images (for image compressing) 

- build (for building project for client)  


### MOST IMPORTANT: 

- use semantic tags (header, footer, section etc.) 

- use flex for layouts 

- markup shouldnâ€™t be broke if we delete some element 

- use BEM naming 

- use Swiper for slider if it presents in design (https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api) 

- use such breakpoints:  

  - 1280 px and more: PC, Mac and tablets in landscape format,  

  - 768-1279 px: tablets in portrait format,  

  - 0-767 px: mobiles in portrait format 
 

### WOULD BE A PLUS:  

- pixel perfect markup 

- a11y injection
